            <h2>Definition of Art</h2>
            <p>Art can be defined as the expression or application of human creativity, skill, and imagination. It is
                often appreciated for its beauty or emotional power and encompasses a wide range of activities and
                forms. The definition of art varies greatly depending on cultural, historical, and personal
                perspectives.</p>

            <h2>What Art Means to Me</h2>
            <p>To me, art is present in everything that we do on a daily basis. Whether it is the job we have, where we
                can say we make art through our work, or cooking a meal, which can be considered art with food. Even our
                hobbies can be defined as art because this word can be present anywhere in our lives. Art is a form of
                self-expression, a way to show emotions, ideas, and stories without needing to say them out loud. It can
                be as simple as drawing shapes on a piece of paper or as complex as creating a mural full of colors and
                details.</p>
            <blockquote>
                "Art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time." â€” Thomas Merton
            </blockquote>
            <p>Art gives me freedom to explore, to make mistakes, and to grow. It is personal and meaningful in ways
                that go beyond what I can explain.</p>

        <section id="others">
            <h2>What Art Means to Others</h2>
            <p>Art can mean different things to different people. For some, it is a way to find beauty in the world
                around them. A painting or a sculpture might remind them of happy times or make them feel calm and
                peaceful. For others, art is about making a statement or expressing their beliefs. Many artists use
                their work to share ideas about the world, to inspire change, or to tell stories about their culture and
                history.</p>
            <p>People also experience art in many ways. Some enjoy going to museums to look at famous works, while
                others like listening to music or watching movies. Art has the power to bring people together, to make
                them think, and to create emotions they might not feel otherwise. It is a universal language that can be
                understood in every corner of the world.</p>
